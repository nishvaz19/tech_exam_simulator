    question: "When migrating from Apache Hive to Apache Iceberg, which 'in-place' mechanism creates a new table without rewriting data files?",
    options: [
      "Iceberg 'Snapshot' procedure",
      "Iceberg 'Migrate' procedure",
      "Hive Metastore 'Sync' command",
      "Iceberg 'Import' function"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "The 'Migrate' procedure replaces the Hive table with an Iceberg table by mapping existing data files into a new Iceberg manifest list without data duplication."

    category: "architecture",
    question: "In a Data Mesh architecture, what is the 'Architectural Quantum' used to define a Data Product?",
    options: [
      "A single SQL view",
      "A centralized data warehouse cluster",
      "An autonomous unit containing data, code, and infrastructure",
      "A shared metadata repository"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Data Mesh defines a Data Product as an encapsulated unit (quantum) that includes its own data, the code to process it, and the infrastructure needed to serve it."

    id: 73,
    difficulty: "medium",
    category: "performance",
    question: "Which factor most heavily influences the physical design of an Apache HBase Row Key for high-throughput streaming?",
    options: [
      "Third Normal Form (3NF) requirements",
      "The number of Kafka partitions",
      "Prevention of region server 'hotspotting'",
      "The size of the Java Heap"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "HBase stores data lexicographically; row keys must be designed (often using hashing or salting) to distribute writes evenly across region servers and avoid hotspotting."

    id: 74,
    difficulty: "medium",
    category: "mlops",
    question: "In an MLOps pipeline, what is the primary cause of 'Training-Serving Skew'?",

      "Slow network latency",
      "Inconsistent feature logic between batch training and real-time inference",
      "Low GPU utilization",
      "Using different versions of Python"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Skew occurs when the data preprocessing logic used for model training differs from the logic applied during real-time scoring in production."

    category: "data-modelling",
    question: "Which step is critical when translating a Logical Data Model into a Physical Model for a NoSQL database like HBase or Cassandra?",
    options: [
      "Ensuring all tables are in 5th Normal Form",
      "Modelling tables based on specific query access patterns",
      "Eliminating all data redundancy",
      "Using only integer-based primary keys"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Unlike relational databases, NoSQL physical models are 'query-first,' meaning tables are structured specifically to optimize for the exact queries the application will run."

      "Asynchronously updating Solr indices based on HBase Write-Ahead Logs (WAL)",
      "Translating SQL into HBase Get operations"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "The Lily Indexer provides near real-time search capabilities by listening to HBase replication logs and automatically updating Solr collections."

      "Schema Evolution",
      "Partition Pruning",
      "Time Travel (Snapshot Reads)",
      "File Compaction"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Iceberg maintains immutable snapshots of the table state, allowing users to query 'as of' a specific timestamp or snapshot ID."

    difficulty: "medium",
    category: "dataops",
    question: "In DataOps, what is the 'Strangler Fig' pattern used for during legacy migrations?",

      "Deleting all legacy data immediately",
      "Gradually replacing legacy system components with new services until the old system is retired",
      "Increasing the compression ratio of Parquet files",
      "Automatically fixing data quality errors"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "The Strangler Fig pattern reduces migration risk by incrementally moving traffic/functionality to the new architecture while keeping the legacy system operational."

    category: "governance",
    question: "In a decentralized Data Mesh, who is responsible for the 'Quality' of a specific Data Product?",
    options: [
      "The Central IT Team",
      "The Data Platform Team",
      "The Domain Data Product Owner",
      "The Chief Security Officer"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Data Mesh shifts accountability to the domain; the business unit producing the data owns the quality and SLA of that specific data product."

    difficulty: "medium",
    category: "streaming",
    question: "How does Apache Kafka ensure 'Idempotency' for producers during a network retry?",
    options: [
      "By deleting duplicate messages in the consumer",
      "By assigning unique Producer IDs and Sequence Numbers to every batch of messages",
      "By increasing the number of replicas",
      "By using SSL encryption"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Kafka brokers use Producer IDs and sequence numbers to identify and discard duplicate requests caused by producer retries after a network error."
