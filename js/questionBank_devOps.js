    question: "You want to implement 'AuthorizationPolicies' in Istio. What is the default behavior of Istio when you apply a single 'ALLOW' policy to a specific workload?",
    options: [
      "All other traffic is still allowed by default",
      "All other traffic to that workload that doesn't match the ALLOW rule is implicitly denied (Whitelist approach)",
      "The policy is ignored unless mTLS is set to STRICT",
      "Istio will crash"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Istio's AuthorizationPolicy follows a 'Default Deny' logic once a policy is applied. If you define one ALLOW rule, anything not matching that rule is blocked.",
    hint: "Think 'Implicit Deny'."

    id: 127,
    difficulty: "hard",
    category: "k8s-security",
    question: "A security requirement states that pods should not be able to escalate their own privileges to 'root'. Which field in the PodSecurityContext or SecurityContext must be set to 'true'?",
    options: [
      "privileged: true",
      "allowPrivilegeEscalation: false",
      "runAsUser: 0",
      "readOnlyRootFilesystem: true"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Setting 'allowPrivilegeEscalation: false' prevents a process from gaining more privileges than its parent process (e.g., via setuid binaries).",

  {
    id: 128,
    difficulty: "hard",
    category: "gitops-operations",
    question: "You are using ArgoCD and need to deploy a specific version of a Helm chart to 'Staging' and a different version to 'Production' using a single Git repository. What is the best pattern?",
    options: [
      "Create two separate Git repositories",
      "Use a 'Helm Umbrella Chart' or 'Kustomize + Helm' to override the 'targetRevision' or 'chart version' per environment folder",
      "Manually edit the ArgoCD UI for each environment",
      "Use only the 'latest' tag for everything"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "GitOps best practice involves using a directory structure (e.g., /overlays/prod and /overlays/staging) where Kustomize or Helm values files provide environment-specific overrides while sharing the base manifests.",
    hint: "Environment-specific overrides."
  },
  {
    id: 129,
    difficulty: "medium",
    category: "gitops-security",
    question: "How do you handle 'Secrets' in a GitOps repository where all manifests are public or shared?",
    options: [
      "Commit the secrets in plain text",
      "Use a tool like 'Sealed Secrets' (Bitnami) or 'SOPS' (Mozilla) to encrypt secrets in Git, which are then decrypted by a controller inside the cluster",
      "Don't use secrets; use ConfigMaps instead",
      "Hardcode them in the Dockerfile"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Secrets must never be in plain text in Git. Sealed Secrets and SOPS allow you to safely store encrypted values that only the cluster's private key can unlock.",
    hint: "Encryption at rest in Git."

  {
    id: 130,
    difficulty: "hard",
    category: "kafka-scaling",
    question: "You need to add 3 new brokers to an existing 3-broker Kafka cluster to handle increased load. Does adding the brokers automatically rebalance the existing data to the new nodes?",
    options: [
      "Yes, Kafka rebalances automatically",
      "No, you must manually generate and execute a 'Partition Reassignment' plan to move existing data to the new brokers",
      "Yes, but only if you restart the cluster",
      "No, the new brokers will only accept new topics"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Kafka does not automatically redistribute existing partitions when new brokers join. You must use the 'kafka-reassign-partitions' tool or a manager like Cruise Control.",
    hint: "Data is 'heavy' and doesn't move on its own."
  },
  {
    id: 131,
    difficulty: "hard",
    category: "kafka-performance",
    question: "You notice high 'Consumer Lag' on a specific topic. You check the consumer metrics and see the pods are idle (low CPU/RAM). You want to add more consumers, but you already have 10 consumers for a topic with 10 partitions. Will adding an 11th consumer help?",
    options: [
      "Yes, it will share the load",
      "No, in a single consumer group, each partition can only be assigned to one consumer. The 11th consumer will be idle.",
      "Yes, if you use a Service Mesh",
      "No, you must delete the topic first"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "The number of partitions is the upper limit for parallelism within a single consumer group. To scale further, you must increase the number of partitions for that topic.",
    hint: "Partition Count = Max Consumer Count."

      "Azure Bastion",
      "Virtual WAN or a Hub VNet with a Gateway",
      "Private Link",
      "Traffic Manager"
    ],
    answer: 1,

     OBSERVABILITY: TRACING & CONTEXT
     ====================================================== */
  {
    id: 134,
    difficulty: "hard",
    category: "observability-tracing",
    question: "Your distributed trace is 'broken'—you see a trace for Service A and a separate trace for Service B, but they aren't linked even though A called B. What is the most likely technical failure?",
    options: [
      "The network is too slow",
      "The 'TraceParent' or 'B3' HTTP headers were not propagated from Service A's outgoing request to Service B's incoming context",
      "Service B doesn't have a database",
      "The Trace ID is too long"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Context Propagation is the mechanism of passing the TraceID through headers. If the application or proxy doesn't 'pass the baton,' the tracing system treats them as unrelated events.",
    hint: "The 'Baton' was dropped in the middle."
  },
  {
    id: 135,
    difficulty: "medium",
    category: "observability-concepts",
    question: "What is 'Cardinality' in the context of time-series metrics?",
    options: [
      "The number of times a metric is scraped",
      "The number of unique combinations of label values for a given metric",
      "The speed of the database",
      "The color of the dashboard"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "High cardinality (e.g., adding 'user_id' as a label) creates a massive number of unique series, which can crash monitoring systems like Prometheus.",
    hint: "Unique label combinations."

     ====================================================== */
  {
    id: 136,
    difficulty: "hard",
    category: "sre-operations",
    question: "During a major incident, what is the primary responsibility of the 'Incident Commander' (IC)?",
    options: [
      "Writing code to fix the bug",
      "Managing the communication, delegating tasks, and ensuring the team stays focused on resolution rather than deep-diving into root cause during the outage",
      "Talking to the press",
      "Logging into the database to check rows"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "The IC is the 'Air Traffic Controller'. They don't fly the planes; they ensure no one crashes and that the right people are working on the right things.",
    hint: "The 'Conductor' of the orchestra."

    options: [
      "No one is allowed to talk",
      "Focusing on 'How' the system failed and what 'Guardrails' were missing, rather than 'Who' made the mistake",
      "Deleting the logs of the incident",
      "Firing the person who caused the bug in secret"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Blame-free culture encourages honesty. If people fear being fired, they hide mistakes. Focusing on the system improves reliability for everyone.",

  {
    id: 138,
    difficulty: "hard",
    category: "iac-terraform",
    question: "You are running Terraform in a CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline fails halfway through an 'apply' because the runner was preempted. Now, every subsequent run fails with a 'State Locked' error. How do you safely resolve this?",
    options: [
      "Delete the Terraform state file and start over",
      "Identify the Lock ID from the error message and run 'terraform force-unlock <LockID>'",
      "Manually delete the resources in the Cloud Console",
      "Disable the backend configuration"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "When using a remote backend with locking (like DynamoDB), Terraform creates a lock to prevent concurrent writes. If a process crashes, the lock remains. 'force-unlock' is the surgical way to release it.",
    hint: "Don't delete the state; just break the 'lock'."
  },
  {
    id: 139,
    difficulty: "hard",
    category: "iac-terraform",
    question: "What is the primary purpose of 'Terraform Workspaces'?",
