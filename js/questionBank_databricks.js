options:[
"CSV",

"It adapts to the user's personality",
"It adapts the query plan at runtime based on the actual statistics of the data being processed",
"It changes the cluster size",
"It works on any cloud"
],
answer:1,
explanation:"AQE is a game-changer that fixes performance issues (like skew or bad partition counts) while the query is actually running."

PARTITIONING & DATA SIZE STRATEGY (281 - 295)
===================================================== */

{
id:281,
difficulty:"hard",
category:"spark_performance",
question:"If you have 200 GB of data, how do you decide the optimal number of partitions to create in Spark?",
options:[
"Always use the default of 200",
"Aim for partition sizes between 128MB and 256MB by dividing total data by target size",
"Create one partition per GB (200 partitions)",
"Use as many partitions as there are rows"
],
answer:1,
explanation:"Targeting 128MB-256MB per partition balances parallelism with the overhead of managing too many small tasks."
},

{
id:282,
difficulty:"hard",
category:"spark_performance",
question:"What is a primary performance penalty of 'Over-partitioning' (creating thousands of tiny partitions)?",
options:[
"Data becomes corrupt",
"Excessive overhead on the Spark Driver for task scheduling and increased metadata management",
"The cluster runs out of disk space",
"Spark skips the Catalyst Optimizer"
],
answer:1,
explanation:"The Driver must manage every task; if tasks are too small, the scheduling overhead exceeds the actual execution time."
},

{
id:283,
difficulty:"medium",
category:"spark_performance",
question:"Which factor most directly influences the 'Shuffle Partition' size in Databricks?",
options:[
"The number of CPUs on the Driver",
"The spark.sql.shuffle.partitions configuration (default 200)",
"The size of the S3 bucket",
"The Python version"
],
answer:1,
explanation:"This setting determines the number of partitions used during wide transformations like joins or aggregations."

DELTA LAKE: TIME TRAVEL & VACUUM (296 - 310)
===================================================== */

{
id:284,
difficulty:"medium",
category:"delta_lake",
question:"What determines the retention period for Delta Table 'Time Travel'?",
options:[
"The S3 Lifecycle Policy",
"The 'delta.logRetentionDuration' and 'delta.deletedFileRetentionDuration' table properties",
"The cluster's uptime",
"The version of Databricks Runtime"
],
answer:1,
explanation:"Delta maintains history until the VACUUM command is run, which respects the retention duration (default 7 days)."
},

{
id:285,
difficulty:"hard",
category:"delta_lake",
question:"You run VACUUM with a retention of 0 hours (RETAIN 0 HOURS). What is the immediate risk?",
options:[
"The table schema is deleted",
"Active queries reading older versions of the data will fail, and Time Travel to those versions is lost",
"The cluster will restart",
"The data is moved to the Bronze layer"
],
answer:1,
explanation:"VACUUM physically deletes files; if a concurrent reader needs those files for a long-running query, the query will crash."

Z-ORDER & LIQUID CLUSTERING (311 - 325)
===================================================== */

{
id:286,
difficulty:"hard",
category:"delta_lake",
question:"On which type of columns should Z-ORDER usually be applied for maximum effectiveness?",
options:[
"Columns with very low cardinality (e.g., Boolean flags)",
"High-cardinality columns frequently used in WHERE clauses (e.g., user_id or transaction_date)",
"Every column in the table",
"Columns containing JSON strings"
],
answer:1,
explanation:"Z-Ordering is most effective on columns used for filtering that have many unique values, as it improves data skipping."
},

{
id:287,
difficulty:"hard",
category:"delta_lake",
question:"Why might you prefer Liquid Clustering over Z-ORDER for a table with heavy, frequent inserts?",
options:[
"Z-ORDER is free; Liquid Clustering costs more",
"Liquid Clustering is incremental and avoids the expensive full-data rewrite required by Z-ORDER 'Optimize'",
"Z-ORDER only works on integers",
"Liquid Clustering deletes small files automatically"
],
answer:1,
explanation:"Liquid Clustering allows for faster, more frequent clustering without the 'stop-the-world' overhead of a full Z-Order optimization."

"Define a 'Watermark' to tell Spark how long to wait for late data before closing a time window",
"Restart the stream every hour",
"Use the 'Drop' output mode"

"There is no difference"
],
answer:1,
explanation:"A 10-minute tumbling window is 10:00-10:10, 10:10-10:20. A sliding window could be 10 minutes long but 'slide' every 5 minutes."

options:[
"Shuffle Read Size: Check if the 'Max' value is significantly higher than the 'Median'",
"Task Deserialization Time",
"Scheduler Delay",
"GC Time"
],
answer:0,
explanation:"If one task has 10GB of Shuffle Read while others have 10MB, you have a classic data skew on a join/group-by key."
},

{
id:293,
difficulty:"hard",
category:"spark_ui",
question:"You see high 'GC Time' (over 40%) in the Spark UI. What is the most likely cause?",
options:[
"S3 is slow",
"The executor memory is full of long-lived objects or massive data partitions, causing the JVM to struggle",
"The Driver node is too small",
"You have too many worker nodes"
],
answer:1,
explanation:"High Garbage Collection (GC) indicates memory pressure. This often happens with data skew or when caching very large datasets."
},

{
id:294,
difficulty:"hard",
category:"pyspark",
question:"Why is using 'collect()' in production considered 'dangerous'?",
options:[
"It encrypts the data so it can't be read",
"It pulls the entire distributed dataset into the single Driver node's memory, causing an OutOfMemory (OOM) crash",
"It makes the executors stop working",
"It is a deprecated function"
],
answer:1,
explanation:"Collect breaks the distributed nature of Spark by funneling everything to one node (the Driver)."

"Increase the driver memory",
"Enable 'Backpressure' (spark.streaming.backpressure.enabled) to dynamically rate-limit the ingestion from the source",
"Delete the checkpoint",
"Switch to a Batch job"

{
id:300,
difficulty:"hard",
category:"spark_ui",
question:"Spark UI shows 100GB of 'Shuffle Write' but the final table is only 1GB. What does this suggest?",
options:[
"The data is highly compressed in S3",
"An inefficient join or 'Explode' operation expanded the data massively during intermediate stages",
"The Spark UI is broken",
"The cluster has too much RAM"
],
answer:1,

"Decrease the number of partitions (tasks) to reduce the scheduling overhead on the Driver",
