    question: "What is the primary purpose of the Virtual DOM in React?",
    options: [
      "To directly manipulate the browser's DOM for speed",
      "To provide a blueprint that React uses to update the real DOM efficiently",
      "To store data in the browser's local storage",
      "To handle server-side routing"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "React creates a lightweight copy of the DOM. When state changes, it compares the Virtual DOM with a snapshot taken before the update (diffing) and updates only the changed parts in the real DOM.",
    hint: "Think of it as a 'draft' before the final version."
  },
  {
    id: 2,

      "It must contain at least one number"
    ],
    answer: 1,

  },
  {
    id: 7,
    difficulty: "hard",
    category: "scenarios",
    question: "A component is rendering a list of items using '.map()'. Why is the 'key' prop necessary?",
    options: [
      "To style each item individually",

      "Return a cleanup function",
      "Use the 'useOnce' hook instead"
