      "It requires the method to be static",
      "It only works with private methods"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Spring uses AOP proxies for @Async. If you call the method from within the same class (this.method()), you bypass the proxy, and the task will not be executed in a separate thread."

    options: [
      "The index can only be used if all three columns are in the WHERE clause",
      "The index can optimize queries for (A), (A, B), or (A, B, C), but NOT for queries filtering only on (B) or (C)",
      "The index only works if the columns are sorted alphabetically in the table",
      "The index is used for the column with the longest name first"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Composite indexes are ordered. A query must filter by the first column in the index for the database to use the index efficiently to find subsequent columns."

    difficulty: "medium",

    question: "What is a 'Covering Index' and how does it improve performance?",
    options: [
      "It is an index that covers the primary key only",
      "It is an index that contains all columns requested by a query, allowing the database to skip reading the actual table rows",
      "It is an index that encrypts the data",
      "It is an index that automatically updates all other indexes"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "If an index contains all fields needed for the SELECT and WHERE clauses, the database performs an 'Index-Only Scan,' which avoids expensive row fetches from the disk."

    question: "Why should you generally avoid creating an index on a column with 'Low Cardinality' (e.g., a boolean)?",
    options: [
      "It consumes too much RAM",
      "The database engine often determines that a full table scan is more efficient than using a non-selective index",
      "Low cardinality columns cannot be indexed in SQL",
      "It causes the database to crash during high traffic"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "If a value appears in a large percentage of rows (like 50%), searching the index and then jumping to table pages is usually slower than just reading the whole table."

      "PROPAGATION_MANDATORY",

      "All databases are updated at the exact same microsecond",
      "It is a bug in the system"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "In distributed systems, we trade immediate consistency (ACID) for availability. Services sync up via events, leading to a small delay where data might be briefly inconsistent."

    question: "In asynchronous communication, how does the 'Transactional Outbox' pattern ensure reliability?",

      "By sending the message to Kafka before saving to the database",

      "By using only synchronous REST calls",
      "By encrypting the message broker"

    answer: 1,
    explanation: "It ensures atomicity: either both business data and the event are saved, or neither is. A separate relayer then publishes messages from the outbox table to the broker."

      "To lock a block of code so only one thread can enter",
      "To prevent a variable from being garbage collected"

    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Volatile ensures that every read of a variable comes from main memory and every write goes directly to main memory, preventing threads from seeing stale cached values. It does NOT ensure atomicity."

      "It only works with primitive types"

      "Non-Clustered indexes cannot be used for strings"
