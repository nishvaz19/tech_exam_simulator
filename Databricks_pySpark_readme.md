# 🚀 Databricks Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)

### 📘 Interview & Exam Quick Reference (Delta Lake + PySpark)

For interview preparation, it is best to conceptualize data pipelines using the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)** powered by **Delta Lake**.
This approach ensures **data reliability, scalability, and performance optimization**.

---

# 🛑 0. Prerequisites: Data Source Connection

Before ingestion, configure secure access to cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3).

```python
# S3 Configuration (Databricks Secrets Recommended)
access_key = dbutils.secrets.get(scope="aws", key="access_key")
secret_key = dbutils.secrets.get(scope="aws", key="secret_key")

sc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set("fs.s3a.access.key", access_key)
sc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set("fs.s3a.secret.key", secret_key)
```

✅ **Interview Insight**

* Always mention **Secrets Management** instead of hardcoding credentials
* Alternatives: IAM Roles (preferred in production)

# 🥉 1. Bronze Layer: Raw Data Ingestion

### 🎯 Goal

* Ingest raw data **as-is**
* Add metadata (e.g., ingestion timestamp)
* Enable replay/debugging

### 🔑 Key Concepts

* Auto Loader (`cloudFiles`)
* Incremental ingestion
* Schema-on-read

```python
source_path = "s3a://my-bucket/raw_data/sales/"

df_bronze = (
    spark.read
    .format("cloudFiles")  # Auto Loader (Production Recommended)
    .option("cloudFiles.format", "csv")
    .option("header", "true")
    .load(source_path)
)

from pyspark.sql.functions import current_timestamp

(
    df_bronze.withColumn("ingestion_timestamp", current_timestamp())
    .write
    .format("delta")
    .mode("append")
    .saveAsTable("catalog.schema.bronze_sales")
)
```

💡 **Exam Tip**

* Auto Loader uses **checkpointing** to avoid reprocessing files
* Handles **millions of files efficiently**

---

# 🥈 2. Silver Layer: Data Cleaning & Transformation

### 🎯 Goal

* Clean, validate, and standardize data
* Establish **Source of Truth**

### 🔑 Key Concepts

* Schema enforcement
* Deduplication
* Data quality rules

```python
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, DoubleType, IntegerType
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

silver_schema = StructType([
    StructField("order_id", IntegerType(), False),
    StructField("customer_name", StringType(), True),
    StructField("amount", DoubleType(), True),
    StructField("event_date", StringType(), True)
])

df_silver = (
    spark.read.table("catalog.schema.bronze_sales")
    .filter(col("order_id").isNotNull())       # Remove invalid data
    .dropDuplicates(["order_id"])              # Deduplicate
    .select(
        col("order_id").cast(IntegerType()),
        col("customer_name"),
        col("amount").cast(DoubleType()),
        col("event_date").cast("date")
    )
)

df_silver.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("catalog.schema.silver_sales")
```

💡 **Exam Tip**

* Mention **Schema Enforcement vs Schema Evolution**
* Use:

```python
.option("mergeSchema", "true")
```

# 🥇 3. Gold Layer: Aggregation & Business Logic

### 🎯 Goal

* Deliver **analytics-ready datasets**
* Optimize for BI tools (Power BI, Tableau)

### 🔑 Key Concepts

* Aggregations
* KPI generation
* Star-schema-like outputs

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import sum, count, month

df_gold = (
    spark.read.table("catalog.schema.silver_sales")
    .groupBy(month("event_date").alias("sales_month"))
    .agg(
        sum("amount").alias("total_revenue"),
        count("order_id").alias("total_orders")
    )
)

df_gold.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("catalog.schema.gold_monthly_sales_summary")
```

💡 **Exam Tip**

* Gold layer = **Business-ready / dashboard-ready data**
* Often used by **BI tools & ML features**

# ⚡ Delta Lake Optimization (Must-Know)

```sql
OPTIMIZE catalog.schema.silver_sales;
VACUUM catalog.schema.silver_sales;
```

### 🔑 Concepts

* **OPTIMIZE** → File compaction (small file problem)
* **VACUUM** → Removes old data files
* **Z-ORDER** → Improves query performance via data clustering

# 🔥 Top 3 Interview Pro Tips

### 1️⃣ Auto Loader vs Batch

* Use **Auto Loader (`cloudFiles`)** for large-scale ingestion
* Handles **incremental processing + checkpointing**

---

### 2️⃣ Schema Evolution

* Delta Lake supports evolving schemas:

```python
.option("mergeSchema", "true")
```

---

### 3️⃣ Performance Optimization

* Always mention:

```sql
OPTIMIZE table_name;
VACUUM table_name;
```

## Additional Spark Performance Tuning Points

* **Bucketing:** While partitioning physically separates data into folders based on a column, bucketing distributes data into a fixed number of files (buckets) based on a hash of a column. This is incredibly useful for avoiding massive shuffles on frequently joined or grouped large tables.
* **Data Salting to Fix Skew:** When a specific key has way more data than others (e.g., a null value or a massive client), it causes data skew where one task takes forever. "Salting" adds a random integer to the key to split it across multiple partitions, forcing parallel processing.
* **Dynamic File Pruning (DFP):** Spark can dynamically skip reading files in a large fact table by using the filter results from a small dimension table during a join. It's like predicate pushdown, but calculated on the fly.
* **Switching to Kryo Serialization:** By default, Spark uses Java serialization, which is slow and produces large objects. Switching to Kryo serialization (`spark.serializer = org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer`) drastically reduces network transfer sizes and memory usage.
* **Garbage Collection (GC) Tuning:** Long pause times during execution are often GC overhead. Moving to the G1GC garbage collector (`-XX:+UseG1GC`) and adjusting `spark.memory.fraction` helps keep tasks running instead of waiting for the JVM to clean up after itself.
* **Delta Lake Z-Ordering:** Unlike partitioning, Z-Ordering co-locates related information in the same files based on a specific set of columns, making range queries highly performant without creating thousands of tiny files.
* **Prefer DataFrames/Datasets over RDDs**: Leverage Spark’s internal Catalyst engine and Tungsten execution engine to take advantage of advanced features like memory hierarchy exploitation, code generation, and off-heap memory management.
* **Optimize Data Partitioning**: Distribute data evenly to ensure executors handle similar amounts of work, minimizing execution bottlenecks and data skew.
* **Use `coalesce()` for Partition Reduction**: When reducing the number of partitions, use `coalesce()` to collapse partitions and minimize data movement instead of doing a full shuffle with `repartition()`.
* **Prioritize Built-In Functions Over UDFs**: Built-in functions avoid the costs of row-by-row processing, can operate on entire columns via vectorized operations, and fully interact with the Catalyst optimizer.
* **Employ UDF Optimizations**: When custom logic is required, mitigate performance costs by using Pandas UDFs for vectorized execution, SQL UDFs to execute in the JVM, or broadcast variables for lookups.
* **Implement Adaptive Query Execution (AQE)**: Benefit from on-the-fly execution plan optimizations such as dynamic join strategy switching, post-shuffle partition coalescing, and skewed task splitting.
* **Optimize Small-Table Joins with Broadcasting**: For equi-joins involving a smaller table that can fit in executor memory, use broadcast joins to bypass expensive data shuffle operations.
* **Utilize Bloom Filters for Larger Joins**: In conditions where broadcasting is not feasible, use Bloom filters to early eliminate non-matching rows and minimize the overhead of data shuffling.
