# 🚀 Kafka Interview & Architecture README

### 📘 Quick Reference (Distributed Streaming + Reliability + Chaos Handling)

This is your **Day 1 (design) + Day 2 (operations)** Kafka cheat sheet for interviews.

---

# 🧠 0. Kafka Mental Model (Core Flow)

```id="k1x9pl"
Producer → Topic → Partition → Consumer Group
             ↓
     Replication + ISR + Offsets
```

💡 **Interview Insight**

* Kafka = **Distributed commit log**
* Think in:

  * **Partition = scalability**
  * **Offset = position**
  * **Replication = durability**

---

# ⚙️ 1. Infrastructure & Cluster Architecture

## 🔑 Control Plane

```id="k2z8sl"
Zookeeper (legacy) → KRaft (modern)
Controller → cluster leader
Quorum → majority voting (n/2 + 1)
```

💡 Say:

* KRaft removes Zookeeper
* Controller manages partition leadership

---

## 🔑 Kubernetes & Deployment

* Strimzi (Kafka Operator)
* CRDs → KafkaTopic / KafkaUser
* Helm charts
* Persistent Volumes (stateful)

---

## 🔑 Connectivity

```id="k3x7sl"
Bootstrap Server → entry point
Advertised Listeners → internal/external routing
```

💡 Common bug:

* Wrong advertised listener → clients cannot connect

---

## 🔐 Security

* mTLS → cert-based
* SASL/SCRAM → username/password
* ACLs → topic-level permissions

---

# 🧩 2. Data Distribution & Storage

## 🔑 Core Concepts

```id="k4x6sl"
Topic → logical stream
Partition → parallelism
Offset → message index
Segment → disk file chunk
```

---

## 🔁 Replication

```id="k5x5sl"
Leader → handles read/write
Follower → sync
ISR → in-sync replicas
```

---

## 🔥 Durability Settings

```id="k6x4sl"
acks=all → safest
min.insync.replicas → quorum writes
```

💡 Say:

* Prevents data loss during broker failure

---

## 🧹 Retention

* Time-based
* Size-based
* Log compaction (by key)

---

# 🚨 Kafka Failure Debugging Scenarios (Production-Grade)

### 📘 Format:

**Symptom → Root Cause → Debug Steps → Fix → Interview One-Liner**

---

# 🔥 1. Consumer Lag Increasing Rapidly

## ❗ Symptom

```id="f1k1"
Lag keeps growing, consumers can't keep up
```

---

## 🔍 Root Causes

* Slow processing logic
* Too few consumers
* Partition imbalance
* Downstream dependency latency (DB/API)

---

## 🧪 Debug Steps

* Check:

  * `consumer lag` (per partition)
  * processing time per message
  * partition distribution

---

## ✅ Fix

* Scale consumers (same **consumer group**)
* Optimize processing (batching / async)
* Increase partitions (if needed)

---

## 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “I’d first check lag per partition, then scale consumers horizontally and optimize processing throughput.”

---

# 🔥 2. Messages Being Duplicated

## ❗ Symptom

```id="f2k2"
Same message processed multiple times
```

---

## 🔍 Root Causes

* Retries after failure
* Producer retries without idempotency
* Consumer commits offset before processing

---

## 🧪 Debug Steps

* Check producer config:

  * `enable.idempotence`
* Check consumer:

  * offset commit timing

---

## ✅ Fix

* Enable idempotent producer
* Use **exactly-once semantics (EOS)**
* Ensure:

  * process → then commit offset

---

## 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Kafka is at-least-once by default, so I enforce idempotency and commit offsets only after successful processing.”

---

# 🔥 3. Messages Out of Order

## ❗ Symptom

```id="f3k3"
Events processed in wrong sequence
```

---

## 🔍 Root Causes

* Multiple partitions
* Retries with `max.in.flight > 1`

---

## 🧪 Debug Steps

* Check partition key
* Check producer config

---

## ✅ Fix

* Use **single partition per key**
* Set:

```id="f3fix"
max.in.flight.requests=1
```

---

## 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Ordering is guaranteed only within a partition, so I enforce key-based partitioning and limit in-flight requests.”

---

# 🔥 4. Broker Crash → Data Loss Concern

## ❗ Symptom

```id="f4k4"
Broker failure leads to missing messages
```

---

## 🔍 Root Causes

* `acks=1`
* low replication factor

## 🧪 Debug Steps

* Check topic config
* Check ISR state

---

## ✅ Fix

* Set:

```id="f4fix"
acks=all
replication.factor=3
min.insync.replicas=2
```

---

## 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “To avoid data loss, I ensure quorum writes using acks=all and proper ISR configuration.”

---

# 🔥 5. Poison Pill Message (Consumer Crash Loop)

## ❗ Symptom

```id="f5k5"
Consumer crashes repeatedly on same message
```

---

## 🔍 Root Causes

* Invalid data format

Consumers constantly rebalancing
```

---

## 🔍 Root Causes

* Pods restarting frequently
* No static membership
* Eager rebalancing

---

## 🧪 Debug Steps

* Check:

---

## ✅ Fix

* Enable:

```id="f6fix"
group.instance.id
```

* Use cooperative rebalancing

---

## 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “I stabilize consumer groups using static membership and cooperative rebalancing to avoid stop-the-world disruptions.”

---

# 🔥 7. Hot Partition (Uneven Load)

## ❗ Symptom

```id="f7k7"
One partition overloaded, others idle
```

---

## 🔍 Root Causes

---

# 🔥 10. Schema Breaking Production

## ❗ Symptom

```id="f10k10"
Consumers fail after schema change
```

---

## 🔍 Root Causes

* Incompatible schema update

---

## 🧪 Debug Steps

  * backward compatibility
  * versioned schemas

---

## 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “I enforce schema evolution using a registry with backward compatibility rules.”

---

# 🧠 Ultimate Debug Strategy (Say This If Stuck)

```id="f11k11"
1. Check lag & throughput
2. Identify bottleneck (producer / broker / consumer)
3. Validate configs (acks, ISR, partitions)
4. Analyze logs + metrics
5. Apply scaling or resilience patterns
```

---

# 🎯 Final Architect Answer

> “When debugging Kafka, I isolate whether the issue is producer, broker, or consumer side, analyze lag and partition distribution, validate durability and retry configs, and apply patterns like idempotency, DLQs, and scaling to stabilize the system.”
