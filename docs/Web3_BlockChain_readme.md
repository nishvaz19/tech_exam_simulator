# Technical Architect’s Guide: Web2 to Web3 Transition

This documentation serves as a strategic bridge for Technical Architects moving from traditional enterprise environments (Fintech, Core Banking) to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Blockchain ecosystems.

---

## 1. The Architect’s Lexicon (Buzzwords Defined)

### Core Infrastructure & Banking

- **Core Banking Transformation**  
  The process of migrating legacy centralized ledgers to Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to achieve real-time settlement and transparency.

- **Blockchain**  
  A distributed, append-only state machine secured by cryptography and consensus.

- **Interoperability**  
  The ability of different blockchain networks to exchange data and value (e.g., Polkadot, Cosmos, LayerZero).

- **Cross-Chain**  
  Technologies enabling transactions to span multiple independent blockchains.

- **Hybrid Integration**  
  Architecture combining Web2 backends (Node.js/Python) with Web3 smart contracts to balance performance and decentralization.

---

### Cryptographic Primitives

- **Asymmetric Encryption**  
  Use of public/private key pairs (RSA/ECDSA) where:
  - Public key = identity
  - Private key = authorization

- **Merkle Trees**  
  Binary hash tree used to efficiently verify that a specific transaction exists within a block without downloading the entire chain.

- **ZK Proofs (ZKP)**  
  Cryptographic methods where one party proves a statement is true without revealing underlying data.

- **zkVMs**  
  Virtual machines executing general-purpose code (e.g., Rust) while generating zero-knowledge proofs of correctness.

---

### Standards & Tokens

- **EIP Standards**  
  Ethereum Improvement Proposals defining protocol/application standards.

- **ERC-20**  
  Fungible token standard (e.g., stablecoins like USDC).

- **ERC-721**  
  Non-fungible token (NFT) standard.

- **ERC-1155**  
  Multi-token standard supporting both fungible and non-fungible assets.

- **ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction)**  
  Enables smart contract wallets with:
  - Social recovery  
  - Gas sponsorship  
  - Transaction batching  

---

### Security & Tooling

- **Security First Approach**  
  Code is immutable like hardware → requires audits, formal verification, and fuzzing.

- **Slither**  
  Static analysis for Solidity.

- **Mythril**  
  Symbolic execution-based EVM bytecode analyzer.

- **Echidna**  
  Property-based fuzz testing tool.

- **Hardhat / Foundry / Truffle**  
  Development frameworks (Foundry preferred for speed and Solidity-native testing).

- **Ethers.js / Web3.js / Viem**  
  JavaScript/TypeScript libraries for blockchain interaction.

---

## 2. Software Development Lifecycle (Web3 SDLC)

> In Web3, bugs = potential total capital loss  
> Mindset shift: **"Fail Fast" → "Verify Always"**

### Phases

1. **Requirement Mapping**
   - Define tokenomics
   - Incentive alignment

2. **Architecture Design**
   - On-chain vs Off-chain decisions
   - Hybrid patterns

3. **Development**
   - Smart contracts (Solidity/Rust)
   - Local unit testing

4. **Security Fuzzing**
   - Stress test invariants using tools like Echidna

5. **External Audit**
   - Third-party security validation

6. **Deployment (Proxy Pattern)**
   - UUPS or Transparent proxies for upgradeability

7. **Indexing & Monitoring**
   - The Graph (querying)
   - Forta (threat detection)

## 3. The Token Lifecycle

| Stage              | Action                | Technical Context |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| 1. Minting        | Creation of supply  | `_mint()` function |
| 2. Distribution   | Initial allocation  | Airdrops, ICOs, Liquidity Mining |
| 3. Utility/Escrow | Token usage         | Staking, governance locking (veTokens) |
| 4. Transfer       | Peer-to-peer        | Updates `balanceOf` mapping |
| 5. Burning        | Supply reduction    | Send to `0x0` address |

## 4. Web2 vs. Web3: Architect’s Cheat Sheet

| Web2 Component        | Web3 Equivalent              | Architect’s Insight |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| Database (SQL/NoSQL) | Blockchain / Ledger         | Writes cost gas; reads are slower |
| OAuth / JWT          | Wallets (MetaMask/EIP-4337) | Identity = public key |
| API Gateway          | Oracles (Chainlink)         | External data bridge |
| S3 / Blob Storage    | IPFS / Filecoin             | Store hashes on-chain |
| CloudWatch / ELK     | The Graph                   | Use indexing layers |
| Server/Compute       | Smart Contracts (EVM)       | Deterministic, immutable |
| Microservices        | App-Chains / L2s            | Scale via rollups |
| Unit Testing         | Formal Verification         | Mathematical guarantees |

## 5. Technical Architect Interview Preparation

### System Design Scenario

**Q:** How would you integrate a legacy Core Banking system with an Ethereum-based stablecoin for cross-border settlement?

**Key Points:**

- **Bridge Architecture**
  - Lock-and-mint or burn-and-mint mechanisms

- **Security**
  - Multisig (e.g., Gnosis Safe)
  - Time-locks for upgrades

- **Reconciliation**
  - Middleware (Node.js/Java)
  - Listen to blockchain events via Web3.js/Web3j
  - Sync with internal SQL ledger

- **Compliance**
  - zk-SNARKs for privacy-preserving KYC verification

---

### Security Question

**Q:** What is a Reentrancy attack and how do you prevent it?

**Answer:**

- Occurs when:
  - External call is made before state update
- Risks:
  - Funds can be drained repeatedly

**Prevention:**
- Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
- Use `ReentrancyGuard` (OpenZeppelin)

---

### Strategy Question

**Q:** Why choose a ZK-Rollup over a sidechain?

**Answer:**

- **ZK-Rollups**
  - Inherit L1 (Ethereum) security
  - Use cryptographic proofs

- **Sidechains**
  - Independent consensus
  - Potentially weaker security

**Conclusion:**  
ZK-Rollups provide stronger security guarantees with better scalability trade-offs.

---

## Final Thoughts

Transitioning from Web2 to Web3 requires:
- A mindset shift toward **immutability and trust minimization**
- Strong emphasis on **security and verification**
- Understanding **token economics and decentralized governance**

Architects who embrace these paradigms will be well-positioned to design the next generation of financial infrastructure.
