# 🚀 Senior Architect Interview & System Design README

### 📘 Quick Reference (System Design + Microservices + Cloud + Reliability)

This is your **mental model + buzzword map** to handle:

* System design rounds
* Architecture deep-dives
* Trade-off discussions

---

# 🧠 0. Architect Mental Model (Golden Flow)

```id="a1x9pl"
Client → Gateway → Service → DB / Cache / Queue
             ↓
     Observability + Security + Resilience (cross-cutting)
```

💡 **Interview Insight**

Always think in:

* **Trade-offs (latency vs consistency)**
* **Failure scenarios (what breaks?)**
* **Scalability path (how it grows?)**

---

# ⚡ 1. The “Illities” (ALWAYS MENTION)

## 🔑 Reliability

```id="r9k2sl"
Health Checks → Self-healing → MTTR ↓ → SLA/SLO/SLI
```

💡 Say:

* Liveness vs Readiness probes
* Fast recovery > preventing all failures

---

## 🔑 Scalability & Throughput

```id="s3k9dl"
Horizontal > Vertical
Throughput ↑ | Latency ↓
```

**Key weapons:**

* Load Balancer
* Caching (Redis)
* Read Replicas
* Async queues

---

## 🔑 Resilience

```id="t8k1sd"
Failure → Retry → Circuit Breaker → Fallback
```

Patterns:

* Circuit Breaker
* Bulkhead
* Retry (Exponential Backoff)

---

## 🔑 Maintainability

* Modular architecture
* Clean code
* Auditability + compliance (GDPR, SOC2)

---

# 🧩 2. Microservices & Distributed Patterns

## 🔥 Saga Pattern (Distributed Transactions)

```id="k2x8pl"
Order → Payment → Inventory → Failure → Compensate
```

💡 Clues:

* No global lock
* Eventual consistency
* Compensating actions

---

## 🔥 Outbox Pattern (CRITICAL)

```id="o9s2kd"
DB Transaction → Save Event → Outbox Table → Relay → Kafka
```

💡 Say:

* Avoid **double write problem**
* Guarantees **at-least-once delivery**

---

## 🔑 Quick Recall

| Pattern | Use                    |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| Saga    | Multi-service workflow |
| Outbox  | Reliable messaging     |
| 2PC     | Avoid (slow, blocking) |

---

## ⚡ CQRS

```id="c7k3sl"
Write Model ≠ Read Model
```

💡 Benefits:

* Scalability
* Optimized queries

---

# 🗄️ 3. Database & Data Strategy

## 🔑 Consistency Models

```id="d4k8sl"
ACID → strong consistency
BASE → eventual consistency
```

---

## ⚖️ CAP Theorem

```id="p2k9sl"
Consistency | Availability | Partition tolerance
```

💡 Say:

* In distributed systems → choose AP or CP

---

## 🔥 Scaling DB

* Sharding (horizontal partitioning)
* Read replicas
* Caching layer

---

## 📊 Warehousing Clues

* Star schema
* Snowflake schema
* SCD-2 (history tracking)

---

# 🔐 4. Security & Identity

## 🔑 Authentication

```id="a7k2sl"
JWT → stateless
OAuth2 → delegated access
OIDC → identity layer
```

---

## 🔑 Authorization

* RBAC → roles
* ABAC → attributes
* Least privilege

---

## 🎯 What to Say

* Token expiration + refresh
* Secure storage
* Prevent:

  * XSS
  * CSRF

---

# ☁️ 5. Cloud & DevOps

## 🔑 Deployment Strategies

```id="d8k2sl"
Blue/Green → switch traffic
Canary → partial rollout
Rolling → gradual replace
```

---

## 🔑 Infrastructure

* Docker (containers)
* Kubernetes (orchestration)
* IaC (Terraform)

---

## 🎯 Key Concepts

* Stateless services
* Immutable infrastructure
* Backward compatibility

---

# 📡 6. Observability (VERY HIGH SIGNAL)

## 🔑 Three Pillars

```id="o3k9sl"
Logs | Metrics | Traces
```

---

## 🔥 Tools (mention generically)

* Distributed tracing
* Centralized logging
* Monitoring dashboards

---

## 🎯 What to Say

* Correlation IDs
* Structured logging (JSON)
* Alerting based on SLO

---

# ⚡ 7. Performance & Traffic Handling

## 🔑 Scaling Patterns

| Problem           | Solution           |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Traffic spike     | Auto-scaling (HPA) |
| Too many requests | Rate limiting      |
| System overload   | Load shedding      |
| Slow downstream   | Circuit breaker    |

---

## 🔥 Backpressure

```id="b2k7sl"
Producer > Consumer → Queue → throttle
```

---

# 🧠 8. Concurrency & Synchronization

## 🔑 Core Issues

* Race conditions
* Deadlocks

---

## 🔧 Tools

* Mutex / locks
* Semaphores
* Thread pools

---

# 🧩 9. High-Probability Scenarios

## 🚀 Scenario → Answer Pattern

---

### ❓ “Traffic spike?”

```id="x1k9sl"
HPA → Load Balancer → Cache → Read Replicas → Queue
```

---

### ❓ “Distributed transaction fails?”

```id="y2k8sl"
Saga → Compensating Transactions → Idempotency
```

---

### ❓ “Zero downtime deployment?”

```id="z3k7sl"
Blue/Green → Health checks → Backward compatibility
```

---

### ❓ “Service keeps failing?”

```id="q4k6sl"
Circuit Breaker → Retry → Fallback
```

---

### ❓ “Data inconsistency?”

```id="w5k5sl"
Outbox → Event-driven → Eventual consistency
```
